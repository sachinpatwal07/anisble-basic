example ansible.cfg  

------------------------------------------------------------
[defaults]
# The [defaults] section specifies general configuration options for Ansible.

host_key_checking = False
# Disables SSH host key checking. If set to False, Ansible will not verify the SSH key of the remote host,
# which can prevent connection issues with hosts that are not yet known to the controller.

inventory = ./inventory
# Specifies the file or directory where Ansible should look for its inventory (list of managed hosts).
# Here, the inventory is set to be in the current directory and named 'inventory'.

forks = 5
# Defines the maximum number of parallel processes (or forks) that Ansible will use to execute tasks.
# In this case, Ansible will use up to 5 parallel processes.

log_path = /var/log/ansible.log
# Sets the file path where Ansible will write its log output.
# This is useful for debugging and monitoring Ansible executions.

[privilege_escalation]
# The [privilege_escalation] section specifies configuration options for privilege escalation.

become = true
# Enables privilege escalation for tasks that require higher permissions.
# If set to true, Ansible will attempt to escalate privileges when necessary.

become_method = sudo
# Specifies the method of privilege escalation to use.
# In this case, Ansible will use the 'sudo' command to escalate privileges.

become_ask_pass = False
# Determines whether Ansible should prompt for the privilege escalation password.
# If set to False, Ansible will not prompt for the password and will assume it can execute sudo without a password.
