<=================================play book (myplaybook.yml)

Ansible playbook is a YAML file that automates series of tasks on managed hosts.

YAML: Human-readable format.
Tasks and Modules: Perform actions using pre-written scripts.
Hosts: Specifies which hosts tasks should run on.
Plays: Playbooks contain plays with tasks and configurations for hosts.
Roles: Organize related tasks, variables, and templates for modularity.
Variables: Store data like settings or paths for flexibility.
Conditionals: Execute tasks based on conditions.
Handlers: Triggered by tasks when changes occur, e.g., restart a service.
Error Handling: Define strategies for handling execution errors.
Idempotency: Safe to run multiple times without unintended changes.
